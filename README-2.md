## 🧠 Business Problem

Online retail businesses lose significant revenue due to **customer churn**.  
This project answers two critical business questions:

1. Who are our most valuable and at-risk customers?
2. Can we predict churn early enough to take action?

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Segment customers using **RFM Analysis** and **K-Means Clustering**
- Identify **loyal**, **high-value**, and **churn-risk** customers
- Build **machine learning models** to predict churn
- Deliver **actionable insights** through an interactive Power BI dashboard

## 🔎 Key Analytical Components

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering  
**Tools:** SQL, Python

- Removed cancelled and invalid transactions  
- Handled missing values and inconsistent timestamps  
- Engineered key business metrics:
  - Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)
  - Average Order Value (AOV)
  - Customer lifetime spend

**RFM Metrics**
- **Recency:** Days since last purchase  
- **Frequency:** Number of transactions  
- **Monetary:** Total spend
